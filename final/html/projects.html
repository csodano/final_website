                                For the past 8 months, I've been collecting EEG, fMRI, and TMS data for a study designed by Dr. Justin Riddle which investigates the role of theta and alpha oscillations in the cognitive control of working memory. This project uses peak power frequency individualization as well as fMRI guided TMS.

                                I performed an independent study in the spring semester of 2023 to analyze behavioral data from a visual working memory task for evidence of bias. I am preparing the manuscript of the results of an analysis of this bias strategy that ran agianst what we instructed participants to do.
